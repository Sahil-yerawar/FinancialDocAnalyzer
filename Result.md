- At the time of the submission, I had worked all the relevant fields except
  persons. For the remaining others, final csv has been created under `Results`
  folder.
- The implementation is still computing all the fields to create the required csv.
- There may be some cases whereby the fields are left blank. They may arise due to
  factual inaccuracy in the pdfs present or the information is present in a format
  which may need some extra effort for a handful of cases. The implementation is
  still improving in capturing all the data and would be reflected in the next commit.
